# Script for finding redundant HMM hits (proteins with more than one hit from different HMMs) in metagenomic datasets in filtered results datasets from HMM_search_and_parse_and_extract.py (Erick)

# usage: 


# sort files after protein ident

# compare e-values in column 3

# delete line with higher e-value

# write out filtered file
